# Sharding

## What is Sharding?

Sharding is the process of breaking up your bot into smaller pieces so that it has a better time handling
events. As [Discord's Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding) puts
it, sharding is "a method of user-controlled guild sharding which allows for splitting events across
several gateway connections."

Sharding is used only for large bots and takes up additional resources for managing the new processes.

Just because you _can_ shard your bot doesn't mean you _should_. While Pycord makes it easy to shard
your bot, it isn't necessary to shard unless your bot is large. Sharding a small bot isn't
just useless, but _harmful_, as it uses extra resources and may slow down your bot. Discord
themselves will let you know when your bot needs sharding, so you won't need to worry about this until they contact you.

## How Do I Shard in Pycord?

Sharding in Pycord is straightforward although more advanced than v2 to enable higher scalability.

### Basic Sharding

For most bots which need to shard on pycord, basic unclustered sharding is most likely what you need.

All you have to do is specify a `shards` option in your `pycord.Bot`

Like so

```python
import pycord

bot = pycord.Bot(..., shards=2)

bot.run(...)
```

### Advanced Multi-Process Sharding

For bots that are massive, or have massive workloads, 
you would most likely want to scale using multiple cores and even for some multiple machines.
Pycord supports these two options in a simple and configurable way.

The `shards` option on your `pycord.Bot` can be used in another way than specifying an integer,
you could specify **a list**, which makes it easier to configure, let's say, Kubernetes or multi-machine sharding.

When running your bot clustered, instead of using `bot.run`, you'll need to use `bot.run_cluster`.
`bot.run_cluster` takes the same parameters as `bot.run` but also adds some. You're required to have a 
`clusters` parameter which specifies how many clusters (processes) should be run on your machine.

You could also specify an `amount` to display how many shards you are already running, 
and a `managers` parameter that specifies how many shard managers to run per cluster.

Shards are already distributed throughout every cluster automatically, so specifying is not needed.
`amount` is also only needed if you are running with multiple machines, if not, don't specify it.

## Why Should I Shard my Bot?

Sharding is very necessary for big bots. While your bot grows, it gets harder for your bot to control
how many guilds it is in and what parts of your code should do what. This is exactly what sharding
handles, it makes all of this easier for your bot. Remember, though, only shard your bot once it's
big enough, and that's at _least_ 1,000 guilds.
