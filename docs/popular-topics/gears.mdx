This article explains in thorough detail how to use the Gears system.

Gears are a way to organize your events & commands often in separate files.
They are different from discord.js's per-file system, commonly used as multiple commands or events, normally in a single Gear.

## Getting Started

Compared to v2, v3's new strategy involves much less boilerplate and removes the need for useless subclassing.

Firstly, you'll want to make a folder to store your Gears. You can name this whatever you want, for this example, though, we'll simply name it `gears`.

Then, make a python file named whatever you want, this will store your Gear. For this example, we'll just use `show_guilds.py`

We can then create our Gear.

```python title="./gears/show_guilds.py"
import pycord
from pycord.ext import gears

show_guilds = gears.Gear()

@show_guilds.listen("on_guild_create")
async def on_guild_create(guild: pycord.Guild) -> None:
    print(guild.name)
```

Once created, you're gonna want to attach your gear to your bot.
It should be as easy as so:

```python title="./cogs/greetings.py"
import pycord
from gears.show_guilds import show_guilds

# initialize bot
bot = pycord.Bot(...)

show_guilds.attach(bot)

bot.run(...)
```
